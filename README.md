# etch-a-sketch

Etch-A-Sketch project for The Odin Project.

Creating an Etch-A-Sketch program where people will be able to make art by using their mouse on the grid squares, change the size of the grid and clear it to start all over.

# Plan

* Users will click on a grid square for it to change color. 
* Users will be able to clear the grid with the click of a button 
* The size of the grid can be lowered or increased by using a slider
